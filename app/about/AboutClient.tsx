        <p className="mb-4">
          This app was created by a curler who wanted to bring something new to
          the sport — a fantasy experience built around strategy, excitement, and
          the unique rhythm of curling. The goal has always been simple: make it
          fun to follow events, compete with friends, and feel more connected to
          the game.

        <h2 className="text-lg font-medium text-white mt-6 mb-2">Why This Exists</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Curling is full of momentum swings, precision, and decision‑making.
          Fantasy sports highlight those moments, and curling deserves that same
          spotlight. This platform is designed to celebrate the sport, elevate the
          fan experience, and bring the community together in a new way.

        <h2 className="text-lg font-medium text-white mt-6 mb-2">The Vision</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The vision is to continue growing this into the best curling‑focused
          fantasy platform out there — simple to use, fun to compete in, and built
          with respect for the sport. As the community grows, new features, stats,
          and league formats will be shaped by your feedback.
        </p>

          discovered the sport and fell in love with it, this app is for you.
