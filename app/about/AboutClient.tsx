              Built by a Curler
            </h2>
            <p>
              This website was created by a curler who wanted to bring something new to
              the sport. The goal has always been simple: make it fun to follow events,
              compete with friends, and feel more connected to the game.

              Why This Exists
            </h2>
            <p>
              Curling is full of momentum swings, precision, and decision‑making.
              Fantasy sports highlight those moments, and curling deserves that same
              spotlight. This platform is designed to celebrate the sport, elevate the
              fan experience, and bring the community together in a new way.

              The Vision
            </h2>
            <p>
              The vision is to continue growing this into the best curling fantasy
              platform out there by focusing on ease of use, friendly competition, and
              respect for the sport. As the community grows, new features, stats, and
              league formats will be shaped by your feedback.
